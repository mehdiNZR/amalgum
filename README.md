Getting Started
---------------

To start working on this project, you should "fork" this project. In the
context of GitHub's git policies, "forking" and "cloning" are the same thing;
in the end, all you're doing is making a copy of the repository's files. 

(read through this once, but don't execute the commands until you read the whole thing)
To do the above, I suggest you get a git gui like github's own ui, or 
sourcetree. To execute the "cloning" process, both those ui's have a "clone" 
button, where you would then proceed to give the https clone URL (it's on the 
right side of this page). 
- sourcetree download links:
	windows: http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/download/
	mac: http://downloads.atlassian.com/software/sourcetree/SourceTree_1.8.1.dmg

Once you download that, make an account on github. To tell you the truth, 
I'm not sure if you actually NEED to do create an account, but just do it for 
safe measure. 

Once running the client, you should see either an "Add" or "Clone" repo. Click
that and paste this into the text-box:
	https://github.com/<YOUR USERNAME>/amalgum.git

You might also be given the option to select a path in which your cloned repo will 
reside. If so, choose any place you'd like. If that new directory contains zero files,
it's because you must then execute the "pull" command. There should be a button for this
too. If you're not all too familiar with interface, essentially what you should be aware
of is the following: 
	- "Master" - this is the root or master or base, whatever term you wish to use.
	In our case, and in most others, it's the original repository. AND in fact, it
	literally means the original repository with respect to server it is residing on -
	somewhere in GitHub,inc., USA. 
	- "Remote" - this is the term used to describe any and all LOCAL repositories
	sitting snuggily in your harddrive. 

(START HERE)
Ok, you SHOULD create a github account and here's why. Once you create an account, you
can go to my github account, and navigate to our project amalgum. There is a button on 
the top right called "Fork". If you have a github account, what clicking that button 
does is create a github-server-side clone of my server-side repo (amalgum) onto your
github account's reserved space. Once you click "Fork", you'll see that you too now have
a repository on your account. From your own github account, follow the steps mentioned 
above (copy the clone URL from your repo list, click "Clone" on the client you're using, 
past URL, etc.).
